<h1>What is lorem ipsum?</h1>

<p><b>Lorem Ipsum </b>is simply dummy text of the printing and typeseting industry .lorem ipsum has been the industrys standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,when an unknow printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book .it has survived not only five centuries .but also the leap into electronic typeseting remaining esentially unchanged .it was popularised in the 1960s with the releas of letraset sheets containing lorem ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like<u><b> Aldus Pagemaker</b></u> including versions of<U>Lorem Ipsum</U> <b>1914 translation by H. Rackham.</b></P>

<blockquote>But i must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and i will give you complete account of the system and expound the actual teaching of the great explore of the truth,the master builder of human happiness.no one reject,dislike or avoids pleasure itself,because it is pleasure but because those who do not know how to pursure pleasure rationaly encounter consequences that are extremely painful.nor again is there anyone who love or pursure or desires to obtain pain of itself becouse it is pain,but because occasionally circumstances occur in with toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure.</blockquote>

<h2>Why do we use it?</h2>
<p>In is a long established fact that a reader will be disracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout.The point of using<u> Lorem Ipsum</u> is that it has a more-less normal distribution of letters as opposed to using "content here,conten here"making it look like readable english many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use lorem ipsum as their default mode text and a sesrch for "lorem ipsum" will uncover many web sites still in thier infancy. varions verions have evolved over the years,sometimes by accident.sometimes on purpose(injected humour and the like).</p>
<h3>Where can i get some?</h3>
<p><b>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum avaibale,but the majority have suffered alteration in some form,by injected humour,or <u>randomized words</u> which dont look even slighty believable.</b>if you are going to use a passage of lorem ipsum,you need to be sure there isnt anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text .all the lorem ipsum generator on the internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary.making this the first true generator on the internet.it uses a  dictionary of over 200 latin words combined with a handful of model sentence structures,to generate lorem ipsum which looks resonable.the generated lorem ipsum is therefore always free from repetition,injected humour,or non-characteristic words ect.</p>
